        <h1>On 'Non-scientific' claims</h1>
        <h2>(How Modern day 'Science' has become a cult against 'irrationality')</h2>
        
        <h3>What Science actually is and isn't</h3>
        <p>
            What is Science.? People think of various definitions when they hear the term 'science'. Maybe, they think of Newton, Albert Einstein, and a bunch of other great thinkers.
            Maybe, they even think of their one snarky teacher that would yell about cells. But for others, Science has become nothing more than a synonym for truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neil DeGrasse's famous throwaway line is:
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            "The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it."
        </p>

        <p>
            Gone are the days of embracing never having absolute certainty, embrace the days where you <b>MUST</b> agree to science with 100% certainty. If you don't, then you are a
            horrible traitor! You must also be irrational, stupid, and probably a 'fundie'. Does this not raise some eyebrows in people? This is precisely what cults do, they gaslight
            you into thinking that you are a horrible monster because you had a differenting opinion.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is all coming from An Atheist who embraces Evolution. I am not biased towards any non-scientific arguments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Science is not truth, it is a umbrella term that refers to a collection of tools that we use to understand the truth. Science never changes, just our understanding of it.
            This idea that Science must be unquestioned and kept sacred has led to a lot of poor theories. It's socially robbed people of their freedom of speech, freedom to think and criticize.
            A good example of this is irrational numbers; the only reason to why these are still taunted as 'real integers' is because it is never questioned.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've ran discussion threads all encouraging people to criticize this position, and all I normally got was a bunch of incompetent insults for even daring to question what was established.
            That's another story for another time, it really proved to me the actual viewpoint the general public has on science.
        </p>

        <p>
            These are the same people that tell you to just trust the statistics and numbers, thinking that's all they need in order to reach a logical conclusion. This is purely Reddit brained.
            These same people will often never question the validilty of the numbers, how those numbers were arrived at, or even which points on the graph or obfuscated. This drastically sways the public
            into mindless group think.
        </p>

        <h3>In defense of 'fundies'</h3>

        <p>
            A True scientist will never tell you to just trust the science; they will tell you to look at the science, and test it. Somebody who is truly into critical thinking and
            reaching accurate knowledge on a matter will always look beyond the statistics. Statistics themselves have been essentially worshipped as absolute fact.
        </p>

        <p>
            But I've already made all this clear in my last section, what about fundies? I've stated before that the cult consensus around Science and numbers is: "If you don't agree with us, you must be an stupid, irrational person."
            Any claims of something unimaginable are outed as 'superstition' or 'nonsense'. This isn't me agreeing with any psuedo-scientific ideology, but this is me stating the nuances.
            People buy crystals and 'magic necklasses' because they swear on their own life, they've experienced some effect in their life.
        </p>

        <p>
            A good example of this is the placebo effect. People swear on certain pills (Which were later revealed to be fake) because they've worked for them. Although we don't know
            how exactly this works, it is shown that the state of mind is a variable of success.
        </p>

        <p>
            People don't buy into 'nonsense' purely out of irrationality, they buy it because they know that regardless of what everyone said, somethings changed.
        </p>

        <h3>True Rationality</h3>

        <p>
            True rationality isn't looking at what a book says and taking it as mere fact. True rationality isn't looking at statistics made by anyone and never thinking beyond.
            True rationality isn't trusting 'the experts' without engaging any of your own judgement.
        </p>

        <p>
            True rationality <b>IS</b> putting the claim into practice and testing it. True rationality <b>IS</b> thinking about semantics of how data and information was gathered.
            True rationality <b>IS</b> disobeying worldwide society group think. Be rational.
        </p>
