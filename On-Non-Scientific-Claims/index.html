        <h1>On 'Non-scientific' claims</h1>
        <h2>(How Modern day 'Science' has become a cult against 'irrationality')</h2>
        
        <h3>What Science actually is and isn't</h3>
        <p>
            What is Science.? People think of various definitions when they hear the term 'science'. Maybe, they think of Newton, Albert Einstein, and a bunch of other great thinkers.
            Maybe, they even think of their one snarky teacher that would yell about cells. But for others, Science has become nothing more than a synonym for truth.

            Neil DeGrasse's famous throwaway line is:
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            "The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it."
        </p>

        <p>
            Gone are the days of embracing never having absolute certainty, embrace the days where you <b>MUST</b> agree to science with 100% certainty. If you don't, then you are a
            horrible traitor! You must also be irrational, stupid, and probably a 'fundie'. Does this not raise some eyebrows in people? This is precisely what cults do, they gaslight
            you into thinking that you are a horrible monster because you had a differenting opinion.

            This is all coming from An Atheist who embraces Evolution. I am not biased towards any non-scientific arguments.

        <p>
            Science is not truth, it is a umbrella term that refers to a collection of tools that we use to understand the truth. Science never changes, just our understanding of it.
            This idea that Science must be unquestioned and kept sacred has led to a lot of poor theories. It's socially robbed people of their freedom of speech, freedom to think and criticize.
            A good example of this is irrational numbers; the only reason to why these are still taunted as 'real integers' is because it is never questioned.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've ran discussion threads all encouraging people to criticize this position, and all I normally got was a bunch of incompetent insults for even daring to question what was established.
            That's another story for another time, it really proved to me the actual viewpoint the general public has on science.
